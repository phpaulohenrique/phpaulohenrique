### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Paulo Henrique, a Full Stack Developer with a degree in Systems Analysis and Development.

I've dedicated myself to building a strong career in software development, and along the way, I've honed skills in both back-end and front-end technologies. Here are some of the tools and frameworks I work with:

![React](https://img.shields.io/badge/ReactJS-05122A?.svg?style=flate&logo=react&logoColor=0098d4)
![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/NextJS-05122A?style=flate&logo=next.js&logoColor=0d0d0d)  


Recently, Iâ€™ve focused on writing tests, a skill that has significantly improved my ability to deliver reliable and maintainable software. Testing has become a crucial part of my development process, ensuring that my code is not only functional but also robust.

I believe in persistence and discipline that help me tackle challenges head-on. There's always more to learn, more problems to solve, and more opportunities to grow, and thatâ€™s what fuels my passion for coding every day.

ðŸ’¬ Feel free to reach out if you want to discuss tech, collaborate, or just chat!
